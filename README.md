# Studio Ghibli Wallpapers

I wanted a way to automatically download and use Studio Ghibli wallpapers. So I made this.

I don't own the rights to these images, but they are all downloadable on [Studio Ghibli's website for free](https://www.ghibli.jp/works/). I believe they are taken straight from the movies, nothing added or removed.
